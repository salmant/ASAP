# Self-Adapter
Self-Adapter, which is responsible for adaptation actions, is called by the Alarm-Trigger. Adaptation actions can be initiating new container instances in order to improve the performance of the application or terminating non-required containers in order to prevent over-provisioning. Currently, many commercial cloud providers (e.g. Amazon EC2), as well as container management systems (e.g. Kubernetes), provide rule-based auto-scaling approaches. Some important rule-based auto-scaling solutions are implemented in Java. These solutions can be considered as advanced auto-scaling approaches, which are used in production systems.
